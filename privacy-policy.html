                    <p>Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at ZivaOne, how ZivaOne uses it,
                      and what choices you have.</p>
                    <p>When we talk about "ZivaRing", “ZivaOne”, “zivaone.com”, “we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to
                      ZivaOne, Inc., the company which provides the Services. When we talk about the “Services” in this policy, we
                      are referring to our online moderated communities or workplace productivity tools and platform. Our Services
                      are currently available for use via a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or mobile device,
                      as further described in our product section.</p>
                    <h2 class="space-1">Information we collect and receive</h2>
                    <h3>1. Customer Data</h3>
                    <p>Content and information submitted by users to the Services is referred to in this policy as “Customer
                      Data.” As further explained below, Customer Data is controlled by the organization or other third party that
                      created the team (the “Customer”). Where ZivaOne collects or processes Customer Data, it does so on behalf
                      of the Customer. Here are some examples of Customer Data (but keep in mind they are only examples and there
                      may be others): messages (including those in channels and direct messages), pictures, videos, edits to
                      messages or deleted messages, and other types of files. A user may also choose to enter information into
                      their profile, such as first and last name, job, a photo and a phone number.</p>
                    <p>If you join a team and create a user account, you are a “user,” as further described in the
                      <a href="">user terms of service</a> are using the Services by invitation
                      of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual, that Customer
                      determines its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of
                      Customer Data which may apply to your use of the Services. Please check with the Customer about the policies
                      and settings it has in place.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5">2. Other information</h3>
                    <p>ZivaOne may also collect and receive the following information:
                      <br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Account creation information. Users provide information such as an email address and password to create
                        an account.
                      </li>
                      <li>Team setup information. When a Customer creates a team using the Services, we collect an email address,
                        a team name, domain details (such as team-name.ZivaOne), user name for the individual setting up the team,
                        and password.</li>
                      <li>Billing and other information. For Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services, our corporate
                        affiliates and our third party payment processors may collect and store billing address and credit card
                        information on our behalf or we may do this ourselves.</li>
                      <li>Services usage information. This is information about how you are accessing and using the Services,
                        which may include administrative and support communications with us and information about the teams,
                        channels, people, features, content, and links you interact with, and what third party integrations you
                        use (if any).</li>
                      <li>Contact information. With your permission, any contact information you choose to import is collected
                        (such as an address book from a device) when using the Services.</li>
                      <li>Log data. When you use the Services our servers automatically record information, including information
                        that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you are using it. This
                        log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before using
                        the Services, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your use of the Services, information
                        about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data.</li>
                      <li>Device information. We may collect information about the device you are using the Services on, including
                        what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, application IDs, unique
                        device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on
                        what type of device you are using and its settings.</li>
                      <li>Geo-location information. Precise GPS location from mobile devices is collected only with your
                        permission. WiFi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine
                        approximate location.</li>
                      <li>Services integrations. If, when using the Services, you integrate with a third party service, we will
                        connect that service to ours. The third party provider of the integration may share certain information
                        about your account with ZivaOne. However, we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third
                        party services.</li>
                      <li>Third party data. ZivaOne may also receive information from affiliates in our corporate group, our
                        partners, or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This might be aggregate
                        level information, such as which IP addresses go with which zip codes, or it might be more specific
                        information, such as about how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <h2 class="mt-5">Our Cookie Policy</h2>
                    <p>ZivaOne uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data.
                      We use both session-based and persistent cookies.</p>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer or mobile device to us each
                      time you visit our website or use our desktop application. They are unique to your account or your browser.
                      Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your
                      browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.</p>
                    <p>Some cookies are associated with your account and personal information in order to remember that you are
                      logged in and which teams you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your account but are unique and
                      allow us to carry out site analytics and customization, among other similar things. If you access the
                      Services through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there but if you disable some or all
                      cookies you may not be able to use the Services.</p>
                    <p>ZivaOne sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by ZivaOne and its corporate affiliates.
                      In addition, we use third parties like Google Analytics for website analytics. You may opt-out of third
                      party cookies from Google Analytics on its website. We do not currently recognize or respond to
                      browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p>
                    <h2 class="mt-5">How we use your information</h2>
                    <p>We use your information to provide and improve the Services.</p>

                        of the Services and you may not opt-out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product
                        features or other news about ZivaOne. You can opt out of these at any time.</li>
